A repository containing some raw to burnt cosima-recipe contributions. Mostly comprised of modified analysis scripts used to assess the RYF8485 ACCESS-OM2-01 spinup6, as this spinup was used as the control run for a set of high resolution Antarctic meltwater perturbation experiments. Protocols are generally focussed on assessing near Antarctic water-mass characteristics and dynamics, with a focus on dense shelf water formation and transport. Scripts were developed and run on the National Computational Infrastructure's (NCI) Virtual Desktop (VDI) and utilise tools from the cosima-cookbook (see https://github.com/COSIMA/cosima-cookbook) ocean sea-ice model analysis toolkit.
